# Image-Scripts-and-Shortcuts
Collection of applescripts, javascripts, MacOS shortcuts for managing AI Image generation with Draw Things, and other engines

Most of these are related to automating [Draw Things](https://github.com/drawthingsai), and my app, [PromptWriter](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Ln3tIMgp). Particularly in using Draw Things' HTTP server.

## Applescripts

using Applescripts: download, run

many require the helper app, "JSON Helper" (free). You don't need to do anything with the helper app except download it and leave it in your Applications folder [App Store Link, no affiliation](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/json-helper-for-applescript/id453114608?mt=12)


## Shortcuts (ie 'Siri shortcuts')
